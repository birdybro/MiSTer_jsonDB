# MiSTer_jsonDB
Just some json DB files for Downloader use.

## All Jotego Cores without a Paywall (Just a Test! I learned on this, will delete later most likely)

All Jotego cores and MRA's without the ones that have a JTBeta.zip requirement (paywalled). Add this line to downloader.ini in `/media/fat/Scripts/`:

```ini
[jtcores]
db_url = https://github.com/birdybro/MiSTer_jsonDB/raw/main/Jotego-NoJTBeta.json.zip
```
